<h2> Problem Statement</h2>
According to a perception study, 82% of Indian schools reported that students having a short attention span was a prevalent problem.
The present applications are somewhat erratic, hence a need for a more precise platform that offers options for training, growth, and education in addition to assisting people in understanding their specific learning styles to maximise the learning potential in students.

<h2>Our Solution</h2>
Everybody learns differently. Some students respond better to certain instructional methods than others.

The VARK model effectively identifies and classifies people into four learning styles visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic.
Then, it generates personalised learning content that matches your results, from the concept fed to the system.

Moving forward we even created a discord server customised especially according to the learning groups.
